# Usage
* Add all of the code inside of the application's folder, with your **main.py** being substituted for **app.py**.<br />
* In the main.py file you will need to replace **Line 38** and below with your own application's api.<br />
* Outside of styling some stuff for your own that's all you need to do! Enjoy.<br />
