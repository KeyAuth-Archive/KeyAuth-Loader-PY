# KeyAuth Loader
KeyAuth Loader that is written completely in Python. It allows for the developer to easily add their own program behind this loader using their [KeyAuth.cc](https://keyauth.win) application.<br />

# Usage
* Add all of the code inside of the application's folder, with your **main.py** being substituted for **app.py**.<br />
* In the main.py file you will need to replace **Line 38** and below with your own application's api.<br />
* Outside of styling some stuff for your own that's all you need to do! Enjoy.<br />
# Credits & afterthoughts
**Credits to @6nz for the most of the security checks in this loader.**<br />
<br />
I recommend obfusucating and using PyInstaller to compile. For obfusucation you can use whatever you want, though I recommend [Hyperion](https://github.com/billythegoat356/Hyperion)
